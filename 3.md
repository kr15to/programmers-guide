## Getting Started
This introduction requires a working Cocos2d-x setup to complete. Please ensure that you have gone through the appropriate installation steps for your platform. Please review the Appendix for `Installation Guides`. 

Follow Appendix I for 'Creating A New Example Project'.

Navigate to your new project and open it. This is dependepent upon the platform that you are running on. Please refer to the appropriate Appendix for your installation.

Let's Begin!

## What is in the Project
Everything you need to get started! Platform specific source files, Cocos2d-x and the Resources used in the 'Hello World' sample.

## Creating Your First Scene
'Hello World' has a default Scene, but lets ignore it and create our own.

`File -> New -> File` or `Command-N` and lets create a C++ class.

Select `Next` and let's call our new Scene `MainScene.cpp`.

![](3/3_3.png "Name the new class")

Select `Create`.

Select the `MainScene.h` and paste in the following code:

```cpp
#ifndef __MAINSCENE_H__
#define __MAINSCENE_H__

#include <iostream>

#include "cocos2d.h"

using namespace cocos2d;

class MainScene
{
    public:
        MainScene();
        ~MainScene();
    
        static Scene* createScene();

        virtual Scene* getScene() { return scene; };
    
    private:
        Scene* scene;
        LayerColor* layer;
};

#endif // __MAINSCENE_H__
```
Select the `MainScene.cpp` and paste in the following code:
```cpp
//
//  MainScene.cpp
//

#include "MainScene.h"

MainScene::MainScene()
{
    // get the display size of the device we are using
    Size visibleSize = Director::getInstance()->getVisibleSize();
    Vec2 origin = Director::getInstance()->getVisibleOrigin();

    // scene
    scene = Scene::create();
    scene->setContentSize(visibleSize);
    
    // layer
    layer = LayerColor::create(Color4B(120, 50, 50, 120), visibleSize.width, visibleSize.height);
    
    // finally add the built up Layer to the Scene.
    scene->addChild(layer, 0);
}

MainScene::~MainScene() {}

Scene* MainScene::createScene()
{
    MainScene m;
    return m.getScene();
}
```
And finally, in `AppDelegate.cpp`, replace:

```cpp
auto scene = HelloWorld::createScene();
```
with:
```cpp
cocos2d::Scene* scene = MainScene::createScene();
```

That's it! But the Scene is empty. Lets add some content. 

## Adding Content to the Scene

Lets start to make a simple game!

First, download <> and toss the contents in the `Resources` directory for your project. Add them to your IDE.

Second, past in the following code:

```cpp

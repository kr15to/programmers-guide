# Chapter 4: Sprite and Nodes

## What are Sprites
A Sprite is a 2D graphic.

## Creating Sprites     
        
### Creating a Textured Sprite     
```cpp
auto mySprite = Sprite::create("mysprite.png");
```
### Creating an Untextured Sprite
```cpp
auto mySprite = Sprite::create();
```
### Creating a Sprite From a SpriteFrame
```cpp
auto frame = SpriteFrame::createWithTexture(texture, rect, offset);
    
auto mysprite = Sprite::createWithSpriteFrame(frame);
```        
### Creating a Sprite From SpriteCache
```cpp
auto mysprite = Sprite::createWithSpriteFrameName("mysprite.png");
```
### Creating a Sprite From a Rect
```cpp
auto mySprite = Sprite::create("mysprite.png", Rect(0,0,40,40));
```
## Sprite Manipulation
After creating a Sprite, there are a variety of functions that can be applied to it.

Given:
```cpp
auto mySprite = Sprite::create("mysprite.png");
```
### Resizing
```cpp
mySprite->setScale(4.0); // increases X and Y size by 4.0 uniformly

mySprite->setScaleX(4.0); // increases just X scale by 4.0

mySprite->setScaleY(4.0); // increases just Y scale by 4.0
```
### Anchor Point and Position    
```cpp
mySprite->setAnchorPoint(0.5, 0.5); // middle

mySprite->setAnchorPoint(0, 0); // bottom left
```
    
A few other possible options
```cpp
mySprite->setSkew(4.0); adjusts the X and Y skew by 4.0 uniformly

mySprite->setSkewX(4.0); adjusts the X skew by 4.0

mySprite->setSkewY(4.0); adjusts the Y skew by 4.0
```
## SpriteSheets
A SpriteSheet is a series of sprites combined into a single texture. Using a SpriteSheet will reducing memory usage compared to loading each Sprite individually.

Load your SpriteSheet into the `SpriteFrameCache`, probably in AppDelegate:
```cpp
auto _spritecache = SpriteFrameCache::getInstance();
_spritecache->addSpriteFramesWithFile("sprites.plist");
```
A few examples of working with a SpriteSheet:

Creating a `Sprite` from the `SpriteFrameCache`
```cpp
auto mySprite = Sprite::createWithSpriteFrameName("mysprite.png");
```
Creating an `Animation` from `SpriteFrameCache`
```cpp
auto anim1 = Animation::create();
anim1->addSpriteFrameWithFile("enemystand.png");
anim1->addSpriteFrameWithFile("enemymove1.png");
anim1->addSpriteFrameWithFile("enemymove2.png");
anim1->addSpriteFrameWithFile("enemymove3.png");
anim1->addSpriteFrameWithFile("enemymove4.png");
anim1->addSpriteFrameWithFile("enemymove5.png");
anim1->addSpriteFrameWithFile("enemyjump.png");
  
auto animation = Animate::create(anim1);
animation->setDuration(0.2f);
mySprite->runAction(RepeatForever::create(animation));
```

## What are Nodes
A `Node` can be thought of as a root object. It doesn't draw anything, but can be used to add children and apply its properties to the children. It sets up the scene graph. A `Node` can be sub-classed, have actions applied to it and even be traversed to work with its specific children. 
     
## Creating Nodes  
A simple `Node`:
```cpp
auto myNode = Node::create();
```

Creating a `Node` with children:
```cpp
auto myNode = Node::create();

auto mySprite1 = Sprite::create("mysprite1.png");
myNode->addChild(mySprite1);

auto mySprite2 = Sprite::create("mysprite2.png");
myNode->addChild(mySprite2);
```
